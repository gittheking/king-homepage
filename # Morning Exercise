### Strings

Perform the following tasks using string methods:

1. Reverse the string, `"bananas"`.
2. Return the substring, `"worry"`, from the string, `"What me worry?"`.
3. Convert the string, `"90210"`, to an integer.
4. Capitalize the letter `"m"` in the string `"melville"`.
5. Capitalize all of the letters in the string `"wdi-melville"`.

### Arrays

Perform the following tasks using array methods (note: you might also need to use some string methods):

1. Given the array `numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7]`, create a new array with each element of `numbers` multiplied by three.
2. Given the array `instructors = ["Phil", "Jaden", "Dennis", "Anya"]`, return a new array with only the instructors whose names are exactly four characters long.
3. Given an array, `classmates = ["Andres","Jaskaranjit","Pamela","Raquel","Edward","Eric","Joy","Mohamed","Harrison","Christopher","Pierre","Esther","Victoria","Calvin","Jennifer","Steph","Brian","Zoe","Salvatore","Yuka","Matt","Josh","Nick","Jacob","Meiji"]`
Print the following statements:
```ruby

"Jaskar is my classmate at WDI."

"Josh is my classmate at WDI."

```
etc.


4. Given the following array (of arrays):
```ruby
sandwiches_with_costs = [["blt", 5], ["grilled cheese", 7], ["turkey_club_with_pesto", 9], ["ramenburger", 6], ["portobello and garlic aioli", 10]]
```
Create a hash using sandwich names as keys and cost amounts as values.

**BONUS**: Change the sandwich names from strings to symbols and use these symbols instead. Remember to replace spaces with underscores when you move from strings to symbols.

### Hashes

Perform the following tasks using hash methods (note: you might also need to use some string and array methods).

Given the hash:
```ruby
breakfast_prefs = {
  juice: "orange",
  syrup: "maple",
  potatoes: "steak fries",
  meat: "bacon",
  carb: "Texas Toast",
  cups_of_coffee: 3,
  vegan: false
}
```
1. Return an array containing only the keys of `breakfast_prefs`.
2. Return an array containing only the values of `breakfast_prefs`.
3. Change the value of `:syrup` to `"boysenberry"`.
4. Return a hash with the key-value pairs whose value is of type string.
